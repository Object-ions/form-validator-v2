# Form Validator

This project is a simple form validator built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It checks the required fields, email format, password match, and input lengths.

## Project Origin

This project is inspired by the course "20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript" by Brad Traversy on Udemy. However, I've solved it for the second time on my own and made some changes and added additional functionalities to it.


### Technologies Used:

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JavaScript_
* _Regex_

## Features

- Validates required fields.
- Validates email format using regex.
- Checks password match.
- Validates input length for certain fields.
- Shows success and error messages accordingly.
- Displays a success popup when all fields are validated correctly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. Enter details in the form and submit to see the validation in action.
